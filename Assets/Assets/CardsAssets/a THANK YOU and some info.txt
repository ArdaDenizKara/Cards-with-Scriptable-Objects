thank you very much for downloading this asset pack!

As i said and as you can clearly see, this not necessarily a really comprehensive or focused 
collection of assets, as i made this with a generic idea of a card game in mind, so it will surely
be not tailor made for your game; what i hope with this is that the quantity and general openess 
of the elements of the pack will be enough to get you started, so that you can focus on your card game
without worrying at first of creating, finding or buying other assets for you to test your idea. 

Clearly you can use usa everything in here with every ccombination you desire, but i will attach 
some exemples of what can you do with those, made by me. 

If this pack was by any chance actually useful to you, and/or you had some issues with it, feel free
to leave some feedback on the comments, i'm actually really curious for opinions about this project.

If you would like some more focused asset made with this style, feel free to contact me on itch or any
other social of mine, so that we can discuss about it. 

Cheers, and have a good day!
